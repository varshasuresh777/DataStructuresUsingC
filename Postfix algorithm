initialize(stack)

while not end of the postfix string:
    next token= get the next token from postfix string
	if next_token is an operand then 
	push(stack,next token)
    else if next_token is an operator then 
	operand1 = pop(stack)
	operand2 = pop(stack)
	result = operate(operand2,operand1, next_token)
	push(stack,result)
	
	end if
end while 

print pop(stack)



example:
75+34-*
pushed 6 and 7 ,, found an operator , now pop the operands
operand 1 is 7 
operand 2 is 6
save the result 
now push 3 and 4
now the operator is - 
pop 3 and 4
then next operation
